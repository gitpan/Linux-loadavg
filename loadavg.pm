=head1 NAME

Linux::loadavg - Get system load averages (via getloadavg(3C) system call)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Linux::loadavg;

  @avgs = loadavg();
  printf "load average: %f %f %f\n", @avgs;
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Linux::loadavg module provides simple interface to Linux getloadavg(3C) library
function, which returns the number of processes in the  system run queue averaged over 
various periods of time. Up to 3 samples are retrieved and returned to successive 
elements of the output array. The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing 
averages over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes, respectively.

The LOADAVG_1MIN, LOADAVG_5MIN, and LOADAVG_15MIN indices can be used to extract 
the data from the appropriate element of the output array.

When called without an argument, the loadavg() function returns all three load averages.
